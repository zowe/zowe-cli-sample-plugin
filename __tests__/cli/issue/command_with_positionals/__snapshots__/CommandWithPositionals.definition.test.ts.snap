 * In this case, \\"command-with-positionals\\" is a command that requires positional arguments
 *
 * Property Summary:
 * =================
 * \\"name\\" of the [object]. Should be a noun (e.g. data-set)
 * \\"aliases\\" normally contains a shortened form of the command
 * \\"summary\\" will display when issuing the help on this [objects] [action]
 * \\"type\\" is \\"command\\" which means a handler is required
 * \\"handler\\" is the file path to the handler (does the work)
 * \\"positionals\\" is an array of positional parameters
